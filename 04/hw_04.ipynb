        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Before defining new predictors:** modify the code to generate the dataframe `df_scores` for Random Forest classifier `rf_best` and not a Decision Tree (`clf_best`). Look at for precision/recall rates for different threshold values. You'll see that the precision rate goes up with a higher threshold, but recall (and total number of deals) goes down. However, don't be misled by this, as the financial simulation may show a different view (even with higher precision and fewer trades, you may obtain worse results).\n",

        "\n",
        "**The idea**: Reduce the features list to help models perform better. You may have noticed in the lecture that some of the models (Logistic Regression, Deep Neural Network) are not trained well, likely due to too many features in the dataset. We know there were too many dummies (including ones from the exercise and individual stock dummies). In this task, you are asked to remove most of the dummies from the feature set.\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Define \"DUMMIES_SHORT\" set.** This set should include all dummies from the extended set (DUMMIES) but exclude all dummies starting from 'month_' (month_week_of_month dummies) and from 'Ticker' (individual ticker dummies). Make sure you leave dummies starting from 'Month_' (capital 'M'). To check yourself: `df_with_dummies[NUMERICAL+DUMMIES].info()` should give 299 features, while the new one `df_with_dummies[NUMERICAL+DUMMIES_SHORT].info()` should give only 206 features (32% less!).\n",

        "\n",
        "(Advanced): You should see that simulations on many model-based predictions (names `.._rf_best_..`, `.._clf_best_..`) deliver worse results, likely because the feature set is very different now and you need to re-run the hyperparameters tuning again for Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. You may even see that Logistic Regression and Neural Network start to train. You can find the new best models rf_best and clf_best, and apply the decision rules strategies to improve the results even more.\n",
